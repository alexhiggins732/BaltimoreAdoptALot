This is the initial repository for the code base for the community organized #AdopALot effort to help cleanup Baltimore.

The end goal is to have a fully interactive map to allow visitors to browse lots avaiable for adoption through Baltimore's Adopt-A-Lot program.

Details of the program are here: http://www.baltimorehousing.org/adopt_a_lot

Currently looking for one or more volutneers to convert PDF in /docs folder into a spreadsheet, so it can be imported into a database for GeoCodeing and address of lookup of the avaiable lots.

====================



#Baltimore has an 'Adopt-a-lot' program which gives limited property right for keeping the lot clean.

With a little bit organizing we can coordinate @ScottPresler #AmericansHelpingAmericans with local residents to adopt lots.

#AdoptALot Program details: http://www.baltimorehousing.org/adopt_a_lot 


To get started tge #AdoptALot page has a link to a 128 pdf document listing of #Baltimore lots that can be adopted. I need a volunteer(s) to complie the list of lots into a spreadsheet. I will turn this into a map browsable interactive app people can use.

People can use the app to select lots to adopt. I will automate filing adoption applications with the city. There is also the ability for water turning for $120 year to support gardening/urban farming on these lots. Volunteers can help fundraise to cover these fees.

We can also coordinate donations of volunteer time and supplies, such as landscaping, gardening and cleanup materials. Together as a community we can do the initial lot cleanup and hand them off to adopters. There is even be potential for community activities on these lots.

For example, it could be possible to grow food for the poor and homeless and perhaps employ some needy people to do work supporting these community activities. Any additional thoughts, feedback or suggestions are appreciated.
